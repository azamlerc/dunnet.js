Ron Schnell's Emacs text adventure, on the Web

<pre>Dead end
You are at a dead end of a dirt road. The road goes to the east.
In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off. The
trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
from each other.
There is a shovel here.

### NB
`meli._js` is a minimum emacs lisp interpreter written in JS, which is supposed to be compiled by [streamline.js](https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs).
